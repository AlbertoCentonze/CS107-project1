#How to use the bonus

## Interactive shell

You can find the bonus part of our project in the file named Shell. The Shell is a program that allows you to encrypt or decrypt a message in several different, more or less complex ways.
To be able to start encrypting or decrypting your message you will run the program and follow the instructions. If you have a problem because something is not clear, a "help" command is available to you.
